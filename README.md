# Final project Web II
Jira is a proprietary software product for project management, based on sprints.
This web page is a simplified copy of what is the official Jira page.
This page includes:
* Projects
* States
* Sprints
* Epics(Big Work)
* User Stories(Medium Work)
* tasks(Little Work)

To make it a bit clearer, a user can create projects and assign them to another user. A project has several sprints. A sprint can only have user stories. The rest is divided as follows:
Epic > User Story > Task

It has the following functionalities:
* User(Login, Register)
* Respective CRUD
* Current Sprint (See the current sprint with their respective stories based on a project and states)
* Backlog(List of sprints with stories that have not been assigned)
* Epic List(List of epics with their respective stories and tasks)
* Sprint Planning (List of sprints with their stories, epics and associated users)
* Search (Search for epics, stories and tasks)
